# Testing the WalletTao Loading System

## 🎯 How to Test the Loading Screen

### First Visit Test
1. **Clear localStorage** to simulate first visit:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('wallettao_seen_loader');
   ```
2. **Refresh the page** - you should see the beautiful yin-yang loading animation
3. **Wait 1.5 seconds** - the loader will automatically fade out

### Subsequent Visits
- **Normal refresh** - no loading screen (already seen)
- **New tab/window** - no loading screen (already seen)

### Force Show Loading Screen
If you want to test the loading screen again:

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Run this command**:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('wallettao_seen_loader');
   location.reload();
   ```

## 🎨 What You Should See

- ✅ **Split Screen**: Left half black, right half white
- ✅ **Yin-Yang Dots**: White dot on black half, black dot on white half
- ✅ **Stretch Animation**: Dots morph between circle and oval shapes
- ✅ **Glow Effects**: Soft pulsing halos around each dot
