# Adding Your Logo to WalletTao

## 📁 Where to Place Your Logo

Please add your `logo.png` file to one of these locations:

### Option 1: Public Directory (Recommended)
```
public/logo.png
```

### Option 2: Components Directory
```
app/components/logo.png
```

## 🎨 Logo Requirements

For best results, your logo should be:
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: At least 64x64 pixels (will be scaled automatically)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) works best
- **Background**: Transparent or white background

## ✨ What Happens Next

Once you add `logo.png`, it will automatically appear in:
- ✅ **Loading Screen**: Centered in the taijitu symbol
- ✅ **Navigation Bar**: Top-left corner with "WalletTao" text
- ✅ **Mobile Menu**: In the collapsible navigation
- ✅ **Footer**: Bottom section branding

## 🔄 Fallback Behavior

If `logo.png` is not found, the system will automatically show a Wallet icon instead, so your website will always look professional!

## 🚀 Testing

After adding your logo:
1. Save the file
2. Refresh your browser at `http://localhost:3001`
3. Your logo will appear throughout the website!
